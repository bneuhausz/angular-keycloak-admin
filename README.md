A basic Angular 19 + Angular Material 19 app to provide a limited interface to manage users in Keycloak within a realm.
Docker compose with Keycloak and Postgres for local development included, but settings are obviously not safe for production use.

!!! THIS IS ONLY FOR LEARNING PURPOSES !!!

!!!!! ABSOLUTELY DO NOT DO THIS IN PRODUCTION WITHOUT PROPERLY SETTING UP KC AND HAVING A SECURE API BETWEEN THE CLIENT AND KC !!!!!
